        "summary": "Prepared hide of the racehorse Phar Lap, prepared by Jonas Brothers Studio, New York, 1932.\r\n\r\nPhar Lap was born on 4 October 1926 at the Seadown Stud of breeder A.F. Roberts, near Timaru on the South Island of New Zealand. He was foaled from the sire Night Raid and mare Entreaty, with an impressive pedigree that included such greats as the English racehorses Doncaster (1870-1892), Bend Or (1877-1903) and St Simon (1881-1908), and the New Zealand born Carbine (1885-1914), winner of the 1890 Melbourne Cup.\r\n\r\nListed simply as 'Lot 41', he was purchased on the recommendation of Sydney trainer Harry Telford, by the American-born businessman David J. Davis, for 160 guineas (\u00a3168), at the Annual New Zealand Thoroughbred Yearling Sales, at Trentham Racecourse in January 1928. He was registered as a racehorse under the name 'Phar Lap' by Davis on 3 December 1928 and began racing in Sydney early in the following year. After an unimpressive start as a two-year-old, Phar Lap finally found form to win the Rosehill Guineas in September 1929. From that point on he had an impressive run of 36 wins from 41 races, including wins in the AJC Derby, Victoria Derby, W.C. Cox Plate (twice), Futurity Stakes and the 1930 Melbourne Cup, which he won as the shortest priced favourite on record.\r\n\r\nHis best known jockeys were Jim Pike (1892-1969), with 27 wins from 30 starts, and Billy Elliot (1908-1941), with 7 wins from 7 starts.\r\n\r\nHis feats captured the public's imagination during the early years of the Great Depression and his successes were eagerly followed through the new mediums of radio and cinema newsreels.\r\n\r\nAfter failing to win the 1931 Melbourne Cup, carrying a race-record handicap weight of 10 stone 10 lbs (68 kg), Phar Lap was shipped to America, where he won the US$50,000 Agua Caliente Handicap at Tijuana, Mexico, on 20 March 1932. It was to be his last race. Two weeks later news was flashed across the globe that Phar Lap had died suddenly from a mysterious illness at Menlo Park, California on 5 April 1932. A subsequent autopsy suggested that the probable cause of death was either colic or a bacterial infection leading to severe stomach and intestinal inflammation, however, traces of arsenate of lead were also found in his stomach, leading to speculation that he may have been accidentally or intentionally poisoned.\r\n\r\nDavis arranged for Phar Lap's hide to be preserved and mounted in New York and it was offered to the National Museum of Victoria in Melbourne, where it first went on display in January 1933. Phar Lap's incredible career and tragic death have won him an enduring place in the heart of generations of Australians and he remains one of the Museum's most popular exhibits.",

        "significance": "This compass is a unique item of national significance to the early maritime exploration of Australia and in particular the Victorian coastline and Tasmania.\n\nThe compass was used by George Bass and his crew of six on the expedition in an unnamed whaleboat from Sydney to Westernport Bay between December 1797 and February 1798. This was the first European voyage to explore the Victorian coastline between Point Hicks and Westernport Bay. Notable features include the first European sighting of Wilsons Promontory, and the discovery and naming of Westernport Bay. The length of the voyage undertaken in an open boat, over 3000 kilometres, made Bass's skills in navigation and seafaring highly regarded at the time.\n\nThe voyage provided the strongest evidence to date that Tasmania was an island, separate from the mainland. Bass actually attempted a crossing of the strait on this voyage south of Wilsons promontory but bad weather forced him to turn back. Together with Matthew Flinders' separate voyage to the Furneaux Islands in February 1798, the whaleboat voyage prompted the mission to circumnavigate Tasmania undertaken by Bass and Flinders in the Norfolk between October 1798 and January 1799. After this voyage Flinders proposed naming the strait between Tasmania and the mainland Basses Strait (later Bass Strait) in honour of his friend's whaleboat voyage.\n\nThe provenance of the pocket compass and sundial before the whaleboat journey is not known, however presumably it travelled to New South Wales in 1795 aboard either the Reliance or the Supply. The pocket compass returned to England with George Bass in 1800. It then came into the possession of Elizabeth Waterhouse, who married Bass in September 1800, along with a note from Henry Waterhouse, captain of the Reliance, explaining the significance of the object. The compass was passed on through this family until sold at auction in 1998.", 
        "summary": "Pocket compass sundial used by George Bass on the whaleboat expedition that explored the coast of Victoria as far as Westernport Bay, 1797-98. The expedition provided the first European sighting of Wilsons Promontory and suggested the existence of Bass Strait separating Tasmania from the Australian mainland.\n\nThe pocket compass and sundial was manufactured in London by the eminent optical instrument maker Peter Dollond. After its use by Bass it was passed on through the family of Elizabeth Waterhouse, Bass' wife, before being purchased at auction in 1998 by Victorian surgeon William F. Wilson as part of an extensive collection relating to George Bass.",

It was a shop like no other, crammed with new and second-hand books and other wares, but with the atmosphere of a circus. Cole enticed customers of all ages with a menagerie and fernery, a band, a clockwork symphonion and other mechanical delights. Readers could sit in comfortable chairs, encouraged by a sign: 'Read for as Long as You Like - Nobody Asked to Buy'. The Arcade's proprietor, Edward William Cole, was optimist and idealist, believing passionately in the power of education and envisaged a world without borders, expounding his views in pamphlets and books. Cole died in 1918, still dreaming of a better future. Cole's Book Arcade, one of the wonders of 'marvellous Melbourne', closed in 1929.",

This type of instrument was developed by Paul Lochman of Leipzig, Germany, in 1885, and may be regarded as a forerunner of the juke-box. The symphonion and other mechanical music boxes were very popular in Europe and North America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\r\n\r\nThis symphonion was ordered from the Symphonion Company, Germany around 1889, by Charles Bassett, head of the Music Department at Cole's Book Arcade on Little Collins Street, Melbourne. It was originally set up to play once when a penny was dropped into the slot. This activated a clockwork mechanism that rotated a thin 641mm diameter metal disc with small projections on its surface. The projections plucked the teeth of a metal comb, causing music to play. It was modified in the late 1960s for decimal currency with A 240 v electric motor drive. It has now been restored to run by clockwork, and is still in operational condition.\r\n\r\nCole's Book Arcade closed in 1929, and the symphonion was acquired by Museum Victoria shortly afterwards.",
